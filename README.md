## UFO Search


This project has a UFO data set and a filtering capability connected through html and java script funcionalities. 

First, we obtained the UFO data in a js format. We then built a js function to translate the data into a table/dataframe format. 

Second, we created a series of filters that would allow us to filter through the table on html page. In order to achieve that we wrote two new functions - one to create a set of filters and add respective key/values them to filters dictionary, and another one to loop through the dictionary using filters as condition. 

Lastly, we created an event that listen for changes in each filter.
